Using this with a cross assembler and an eprom programmer is still
a viable way to bring up a small Forth system.
Note that the FIG standard has been superseeded by F79, F83 and ANSI.
What has survived is the FIG implementation model, where you start
with an assembly source listing, not assuming any Forth tools
available.
A print out of this once was available from our user group and a
fotocopy kan still be had from me.
You kan reach me on the Forth gg board 085-422164
